# GitPod Commerce

Install and run a Drupal Commerce Kickstart Demo store in the browser, with a click of a link!

This is a fully-fledged DDEV-based development environment, based on the DDEV/GitPod/DrupalPod/Commerce Quickstart repos.

[Click to launch!](https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/NikLP/gitpod-commerce)

## Notes

- Web port is public by default so the URL is shareable whilst the gitpod instance is running
- All initial config is exported & committed so any dev work will not be swamped by that
- Includes masquerade & devel module as dev modules
